# Project Overview 

The primary goal of this project is to develop a cloud-based, end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application deployed on the Microsoft Azure platform. The application aims to retrieve relevant mental health information from a knowledge base, which integrates data from Counselchat.com and the Mental Health Dataset provided by JIS College of Engineering. The objective is to generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses using a large language model (LLM) enhanced by RAG techniques.

## Project Scope

The project encompasses the following key steps:
1. **Dataset Selection and Preprocessing**: Identify and prepare the combined dataset from multiple sources to form a comprehensive knowledge base.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Ingest the preprocessed data into the knowledge base for efficient retrieval.
3. **Knowledge Base Querying**: Enable querying of the knowledge base to extract relevant information.
4. **Prompt Construction**: Develop appropriate prompts that effectively interact with the LLM.
5. **Response Generation**: Leverage the LLM to generate context-rich and accurate responses based on retrieved data.
6. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the applicationâ€™s performance to ensure response accuracy and relevance.
7. **User Interface (UI) Development**: Create a user-friendly interface for interaction.


## Final Application: AskTheraRAGBuddy

AskTheraRAGBuddy is a cloud-based web application developed using FastAPI, designed to help users answer mental health-related questions. The system is optimized for efficiency and ease of use, leveraging both the Mental Health Dataset and responses from qualified counselors on Counselchat.com.

This application demonstrates the practical utility of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, allowing users to query the knowledge base and receive detailed, contextually relevant responses generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).
